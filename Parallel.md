Process, Thread:
- Process: A `program` in execution, with its own memory space.
- Thread: A lightweight process, sharing the same memory space with other threads in the same process.
- Threads are managed by the OS, while processes are managed by the kernel.
- Threads within the same process can communicate more easily than processes, as they share the same memory space.
